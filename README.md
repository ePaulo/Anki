# Anki

This was created for a Scrimba Student Session introducing the Anki flashcards app.

The GitHub repo will contain Anki flashcard decks

First Deck added focuses on HTML and includes "fill in the blank" style questions that requires a "type your answer" response.

The Anki app can be downloaded from https://apps.ankiweb.net/
